# lab-aws-greengrass

## Introduction

AWS Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. AWS Greengrass ensures your devices can respond quickly to local events and operate with intermittent connectivity. AWS Greengrass minimizes the cost of transmitting data to the cloud by allowing you to author AWS Lambda functions that execute locally.

In this lab you will create an configure a Greengrass instance on the UP2 Board.


## Dependencies 

In order to install a Greengrass core you must have certain dependencies on your device. In order to test for these run the AWS Greengrass dependency checker script found on their GitHub here:
